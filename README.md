# Compile into Lena

The goal of the "Compile into Lena" project is to generate a PNG image in RGB color format from a code and enable the interpretation of the resulting image.

The project consists of two main parts. The first part involves transcribing the code into an image. Each instruction within the code is converted into a colored pixel, which collectively forms the image. The pixels are arranged and read from left to right and top to bottom, creating a visual representation of the code.

The second part of the project focuses on interpreting the code embedded within the image. It includes tasks such as lexical and grammatical analysis, as well as compilation or interpretation of the code to extract its meaning and intended functionality.

The project also explores the concept of hiding the "pixel-coded" image within another "real" image. This technique allows for the concealment of the coded image within a visually different image. Subsequently, it becomes possible to retrieve the original "coded" image.
